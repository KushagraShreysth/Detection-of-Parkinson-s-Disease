## About Project 

In this Python machine learning project, using python libraries scikit learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, I build a model using an XGBClassifier which detects the presence of Parkinson's Disease in individuals using various factors.
I used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of sklearn library to prepare the dataset.
The model gives an accuracy of 95% on the testing dataset.
